## 📲 Auto Alerts

| When | Message |
|---|---|
| Morning 6am–2pm (once) | 🌅 Open price + trend + TA signal |
| Evening 8–9pm | 🌙 Summary + trends + portfolio + prediction |
| Sunday evening | 📅 Weekly recap (week change, high/low, best/worst day) |

> 🔄 Price checks run every **5 minutes, 24/7** — gold trades around the clock
> on weekdays, so overnight runs are what make the gap-down alert possible.
> Pip caching + a concurrency guard keep cost down and stop overlapping runs
> racing on the Gist. (The repo is public, so Actions minutes are unlimited; if
> it goes private, widen the cron to `*/15`–`*/30`.)
> 📌 The day's **open** is therefore anchored at ~00:00 BKK, and the drop/rise
> alerts measure from there. The move across the day boundary itself is covered
> separately by the gap-down alert vs yesterday's close.
> ⚙️ Subscribers can `/mute` categories or set `/quiet 22-7` hours — alerts
> respect each user's preferences.
> 🌐 Each user also picks their own language with `/lang` — the same broadcast
> is rendered once per language actually in use, not once per subscriber.

**Drop Alerts (5 levels, threshold = 0.5% default):**

| Level | Trigger | Alert |

## ⚙️ Setup

### Step 1 — Create a Telegram Bot

1. Telegram: **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → copy the token
2. Open a chat with your bot and send it a message
3. Get your Chat ID from `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`

### Step 2 — Get a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. https://github.com/settings/tokens → **Generate new token (classic)**
2. Scope: check **gist** only
3. Copy the token

### Step 3 — Create the Gist

Run locally:

```bash
GIST_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token python setup_gist.py
```

Copy the `GIST_ID` it prints.

### Step 4 — Add GitHub Repo Secrets

Repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

| Secret Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token from BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Chat ID from Step 1 |
| `GIST_GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token from Step 2 |
| `GIST_ID` | Gist ID from Step 3 |

> 🔐 **`WEBHOOK_SECRET` (required if you use the Vercel webhook):**
> the webhook handler **fails closed** — without this it rejects every update
> with 403. Set the same value in the Vercel project environment and in the
> shell you run `setup_webhook.py` from. Generate one with:
>
> ```bash
> python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
> ```
>
> Without it, anyone who learns the webhook URL could forge the owner's chat ID
> and run owner-only commands against your portfolio.

### Step 5 — Push & Test

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Gold Monitor v2 — predictions + portfolio"
git push
```

GitHub → **Actions** → **Gold Price Monitor** → **Run workflow**

## 🔮 Prediction: How It Works

**Technical Analysis (always available):**
RSI, SMA (5/20), EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Momentum — combined into a buy/hold/wait score.

**ML Model (after 100+ data points ≈ 4 days):**
GradientBoosting classifier trained on historical features. Predicts price direction for 4h, 12h, and 24h horizons. Auto-retrains daily at 3am.

Accuracy is measured **out-of-sample** (train on the first 80%, score the most recent unseen 20%) and compared against a majority-class baseline. A horizon is only treated as a real signal when it beats that baseline (`✅edge`); otherwise it is labelled `⚠️no-edge` and the combined outlook tells you to ignore ML and rely on the TA signal. Gold is close to a random walk at the hourly scale, so do not be surprised when models show no edge — that is the honest result, not a bug.

Both signals are combined for a final outlook in alerts and the `/predict` command.

**Live accuracy tracking:** every evening the bot records its ML predictions, then
scores them once they mature (4h/12h/24h later) against the actual price. The real
hit-rate appears in `/predict` and the evening summary — so you can see whether the
models work in the real world, not just in backtests.

**Reliability:** price history is stored hourly (alert checks still run every 5
minutes); if the monitor itself crashes, the owner gets a 🛑 Telegram alert instead
of silent failure; Telegram rate limits (429) are respected with retry; owner
commands fail closed if `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is unset.

**Dead token → red run:** a revoked `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` cannot report itself —
the alert would need the same token. Every Telegram call is deliberately
error-swallowing, so the symptom used to be a *green run that sent nothing*.
Both entrypoints now detect a 401 and exit non-zero, turning the Actions run red
so GitHub emails you.

**Webhook watchdog:** a webhook that is *registered but rejecting updates* is the
worst failure mode here — the poller self-disables because a webhook exists, the
webhook drops everything, and nothing raises. Commands just stop. Both the monitor
and the poller now check `getWebhookInfo` and send the owner a 🛑 alert (at most
once every 6h) naming the Telegram error and the fix. The check lives in the
**monitor** as well as the poller, because the poller workflow can itself be
disabled.

---

## 🌐 Language (English / မြန်မာ / ไทย)

Every alert and command reply is localised per user.

```
/lang          # show the current language + options
/lang en       # English
/lang my       # မြန်မာ  (default)
/lang th       # ไทย
```

The choice is stored per chat alongside the other notification preferences and
shows up in `/settings`. **Myanmar stays the default**, so existing users see
no change unless they opt in. Aliases are accepted (`english`, `mm`, `ไทย`, …).

Broadcasts are rendered **once per language present among the recipients** —
a 500-subscriber alert still builds at most three message bodies.

Indicator and ticker names (RSI, MACD, DXY, VIX, USD/oz) are deliberately left
untranslated; they read as symbols in all three locales.

**Adding a language:** add its code to `LANGUAGES` and `_ALIASES` in
`i18n.py`, then fill in the new entry for every key in `STRINGS`. The test
suite fails on any missing translation or mismatched `{placeholder}` set, so
an incomplete language cannot ship silently.

## 📅 Event Calendar (why TA alone is not enough)

Technical indicators describe what the price *has done*. They say nothing about
a Fed decision landing in twenty minutes — and that is where gold's largest
moves come from. `events.py` adds the timing of scheduled US releases:

| | |
|---|---|
| 🏛 FOMC | Rate decision, 14:00 ET |
| 📈 CPI | US inflation, 08:30 ET |
| 👷 NFP | Non-Farm Payrolls, 08:30 ET first Friday (generated, marked *estimated*) |
| 🧾 PCE | US PCE inflation, 08:30 ET |

What it does with them:

- **Before** a release — alerts carry `⚠️ FOMC rate decision in 0h 30m — expect volatility`
- **After** one — `📰 FOMC rate decision just released — this move is likely event-driven`
- **Inside either window** — the TA signal is still shown but explicitly flagged
  as unreliable, because "RSI oversold" 20 minutes before CPI means very little
- **Daily messages** — the morning and evening summaries list anything due in
  the next 24h
- **`/events`** — the next few releases with a countdown, in your language

It also feeds the ML model two new features, `hours_to_event` and
`in_event_window`. Every other feature is derived from the price series itself,
which is a large part of why the models honestly report no edge on a
near-random walk; event timing is the first genuinely **exogenous** input.

> ⚠️ **This calendar is hand-maintained and must be kept current.** Dates are
> the one part of the feature that cannot be derived or tested into
> correctness. Top up `CALENDAR` in `events.py` once a year from
> [federalreserve.gov](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)
> and [bls.gov](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm).
> `/events` warns the owner when fewer than 45 days remain.

**It does not predict direction.** It says *something scheduled is happening* —
a fact about the calendar, not a forecast about the price.

## 🔍 Market Regime (detecting a move without knowing the cause)

The event calendar covers moves you can see coming. This covers the rest: it
detects that *something happened* without needing to know what. Two independent
checks, both from data the bot already has — no news feed, no API, no key.

**1. Volatility regime.** Compares realized volatility over the last 6h against
its own 7-day baseline. A jump is the fingerprint of news landing, whatever the
news was.

```
⚡ Volatility 2.6× normal — larger moves than usual
🌪 Volatility 7.5× normal — something is moving this market
❗ Last move -1.00% — 7.9σ vs its own baseline, worth checking the news
```

The baseline deliberately **excludes** the recent window. Including it would let
a spike inflate the very baseline it is measured against — which is how naive
versions of this end up never firing.

**2. Driver divergence.** Gold usually falls when the dollar and yields rise.
When it climbs against **both** at once, the move is not a rates story:

```
🛡 Gold rising against BOTH a stronger dollar and higher yields
   — safe-haven bid, not a rates move
🩸 Gold falling despite a weaker dollar and lower yields
   — looks like forced selling
```

DXY and US10Y are already fetched for `/macro`, so this costs nothing extra.
Yield moves are compared in **percentage points** (3bp deadband), not percent —
for a 10Y near 4.5%, a "0.10% change" is ~0.005pp, i.e. nothing.

The two are complementary: a steady one-directional drift has *low* volatility
(all moves the same sign) but still trips the single-bar shock check and the
divergence check.

Shown in alerts and the evening summary only when something is actually
unusual — a quiet market adds no lines. `/macro` always shows the current
regime. Neither check predicts direction; one says "this move is unusually
large", the other "this move is not explained by the usual drivers".

## 📰 Headlines (context only)

The final piece answers the question the other two provoke: *"something just
happened — what was it?"*

`/news` shows recent gold-related headlines from **Google News RSS** (free,
keyless), falling back to [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) if that fails.
GDELT was the original primary and proved unusable alone: it answers HTTP 429
on most calls from shared/serverless IPs, and its relevance for this query is
poor (mining-company earnings calls, unrelated market wraps). In alerts they appear
**only when the regime detector or the event calendar already flagged
something**, so headlines always arrive as an explanation for a move the bot
detected by other means — never as a standalone prompt to act. That also keeps
the fetch off the hot path for the ~288 quiet runs a day.

**What this deliberately does NOT do:**

- ❌ No sentiment scoring
- ❌ No direction inferred from a headline
- ❌ Never feeds a buy/sell signal, an alert threshold, or an ML feature

Headline sentiment maps poorly onto gold's actual reaction — the same
"conflict escalates" story can precede a rally or a fade depending on
positioning, and the sign is not stable enough to trade on. Presenting it as a
signal would contradict the honest-metrics posture the rest of this project
holds to. Two tests exist purely to keep that boundary from eroding: one
asserts no headline ever reaches the model, another fails if `news.py` ever
grows a `sentiment` / `bullish` / `signal` function.

Headlines are third-party text, so titles, URLs and domains are all
HTML-escaped before they reach Telegram.

## ⚙️ Setup

### Step 1 — Telegram Bot ဆောက်ပါ

1. Telegram: **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → Token ယူပါ
2. Bot နှင့် chat ဖွင့်ပြီး message ပို့ပါ
3. `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` မှ Chat ID ယူပါ

### Step 2 — GitHub Personal Access Token ယူပါ

1. https://github.com/settings/tokens → **Generate new token (classic)**
2. Scope: **gist** ကိုသာ check ပါ
3. Token ကို copy ပါ

### Step 3 — Gist ဆောက်ပါ

Local machine မှာ run ပါ:

```bash
GIST_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token python setup_gist.py
```

Print ထုတ်လာသည့် `GIST_ID` ကို copy ပါ

### Step 4 — GitHub Repo Secrets ထည့်ပါ

Repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

| Secret Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | BotFather မှ bot token |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Step 1 မှ chat ID |
| `GIST_GITHUB_TOKEN` | Step 2 မှ GitHub token |
| `GIST_ID` | Step 3 မှ Gist ID |

> 🔐 **`WEBHOOK_SECRET` (Vercel webhook သုံးမည်ဆိုလျှင် မဖြစ်မနေ လိုအပ်သည်):**
> the webhook handler **fails closed** — without this it rejects every update
> with 403. Set the same value in the Vercel project environment and in the
> shell you run `setup_webhook.py` from. Generate one with:
>
> ```bash
> python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
> ```
>
> Without it, anyone who learns the webhook URL could forge the owner's chat ID
> and run owner-only commands against your portfolio.

### Step 5 — Push & Test

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Gold Monitor v2 — predictions + portfolio"
git push
```

GitHub → **Actions** → **Gold Price Monitor** → **Run workflow**

## 🔮 Prediction: How It Works

**Technical Analysis (always available):**
RSI, SMA (5/20), EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Momentum — combined into a buy/hold/wait score.

**ML Model (after 100+ data points ≈ 4 days):**
GradientBoosting classifier trained on historical features. Predicts price direction for 4h, 12h, and 24h horizons. Auto-retrains daily at 3am.

Accuracy is measured **out-of-sample** (train on the first 80%, score the most recent unseen 20%) and compared against a majority-class baseline. A horizon is only treated as a real signal when it beats that baseline (`✅edge`); otherwise it is labelled `⚠️no-edge` and the combined outlook tells you to ignore ML and rely on the TA signal. Gold is close to a random walk at the hourly scale, so do not be surprised when models show no edge — that is the honest result, not a bug.

Both signals are combined for a final outlook in alerts and the `/predict` command.

**Live accuracy tracking:** every evening the bot records its ML predictions, then
scores them once they mature (4h/12h/24h later) against the actual price. The real
hit-rate appears in `/predict` and the evening summary — so you can see whether the
models work in the real world, not just in backtests.

**Reliability:** price history is stored hourly (alert checks still run every 5
minutes); if the monitor itself crashes, the owner gets a 🛑 Telegram alert instead
of silent failure; Telegram rate limits (429) are respected with retry; owner
commands fail closed if `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is unset.

**Dead token → red run:** a revoked `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` cannot report itself —
the alert would need the same token. Every Telegram call is deliberately
error-swallowing, so the symptom used to be a *green run that sent nothing*.
Both entrypoints now detect a 401 and exit non-zero, turning the Actions run red
so GitHub emails you.

**Webhook watchdog:** a webhook that is *registered but rejecting updates* is the
worst failure mode here — the poller self-disables because a webhook exists, the
webhook drops everything, and nothing raises. Commands just stop. Both the monitor
and the poller now check `getWebhookInfo` and send the owner a 🛑 alert (at most
once every 6h) naming the Telegram error and the fix. The check lives in the
**monitor** as well as the poller, because the poller workflow can itself be
disabled.

---

## 🌐 Language (English / မြန်မာ / ไทย)

Every alert and command reply is localised per user.

```
/lang          # show the current language + options
/lang en       # English
/lang my       # မြန်မာ  (default)
/lang th       # ไทย
```

The choice is stored per chat alongside the other notification preferences and
shows up in `/settings`. **Myanmar stays the default**, so existing users see
no change unless they opt in. Aliases are accepted (`english`, `mm`, `ไทย`, …).

Broadcasts are rendered **once per language present among the recipients** —
a 500-subscriber alert still builds at most three message bodies.

Indicator and ticker names (RSI, MACD, DXY, VIX, USD/oz) are deliberately left
untranslated; they read as symbols in all three locales.

**Adding a language:** add its code to `LANGUAGES` and `_ALIASES` in
`i18n.py`, then fill in the new entry for every key in `STRINGS`. The test
suite fails on any missing translation or mismatched `{placeholder}` set, so
an incomplete language cannot ship silently.

> ⚡ **Webhook vs polling:** the Vercel webhook gives instant replies. Telegram
> rejects `getUpdates` (HTTP 409) while a webhook is set, so the polling job now
> auto-disables when a webhook is configured — the two no longer conflict. Use
> the webhook as primary; polling is the keyless fallback.

> 🧪 **Tests:** `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`
